    <h2> <p class="pmargin w3-text-indigo w3-center"> Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Medium: A Networking Perspective of Blockchain Security: Modeling, Analysis, and Defense</p></h2>

    <h3><p class="pmargin w3-text-indigo">Project Description</p></h4>
    <h6><p class="pmargin">
		Blockchain has emerged as a "secure by design" technology that can provide security among a group of mutually distrustful nodes without relying on a trusted central authority. The fundamental security of the blockchain is based on distributed consensus, which assumes the system is secure as long as a certain threshold amount (greater than half) of the whole network's computing (or voting) power is honest. However, in reality, many factors can effectively change this threshold, significantly impairing blockchain security. This project aims to address these fundamental security challenges in blockchain technology by developing new theories and systems to gain a deeper understanding and guide the development of new defense solutions. The project team will investigate how clustered power in large mining pools, heterogeneous network connectivity, and malicious peer-to-peer network link manipulation can impact fundamental blockchain security. The external data feed is another fundamental security challenge towards the broader application of blockchain technology. Therefore, another goal of the project is to address the data truthfulness challenge, where external Byzantine sources may supply false inputs to the blockchain applications.

        <br><br>

		The research activities of this project focus on three main thrusts. First, the team will examine the fundamental security properties of blockchain through the lens of modeling and analysis of consensus protocols, network connectivity, and other factors in the system, with the goal of providing quantifiable insights on fairness, liveness, and safety of blockchain operation. Second, the will investigate the use of trusted computing to enable remotely attestable policy-driven software-defined networks for defense and mitigation of routing-based attacks on blockchain. Third, the team will design a novel trustworthy data feed mechanism that leverages decentralized truth discovery and off-chain efficient agreement to address the long-standing data truthfulness challenge for blockchain applications.

                For blockchain-based decentralization applications (DApps) to achieve real-world relevance, such as those for equity investment or insurance, they need to feed on data about the external world. However, the validity of the external data is beyond the jurisdiction of blockchain consensus. DApp participants may suffer huge monetary or operational loss if the DApp feeds on data from faulty or malicious sources. This is known as the "external data challenge" or "oracle problem". Our solution, <a href="https://yang-sec.github.io/publications/decentruth.pdf" style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: none;">DecenTruth</a>, leverages truth discovery (TD)—a data mining method—and asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus to realize a fully decentralized, truth-discovering data feed system. It enables a group of mutually distrustful DApp participants to jointly estimate the ground truths of data objects and reliability of external sources from noisy and potentially conflicting (Byzantine) multi-sourced inputs.

                Bitcoin relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer network that is critical for its consensus and security. However, this network is vulnerable to various attacks, such as eclipse and topology inference attacks, which typically require direct access to network traffic. These traditional attacks are limited by their need for on-path access and the associated high costs. We propose <a href="https://shaoyu-li.github.io/files/bijack.pdf" style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: none;">Bijack</a>, an off-path TCP hijacking attack that targets the Bitcoin network by exploiting a TCP protocol vulnerability in certain Linux systems. Bijack allows attackers to hijack TCP connections between Bitcoin nodes without requiring direct access to the communication path, enabling them to inject malicious data or terminate connections. This attack method demonstrates significant potential to disrupt the Bitcoin consensus by enabling topology inference and eclipse attacks without the limitations of traditional on-path attacks.
